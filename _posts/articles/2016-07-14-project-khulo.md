### Introduction
​
Project Khulo is tasked to develop an application that will help the Institutions like the CSIR find sub careers that have the potential of later becoming data science and further help address the shortage of data  scientists. For phase one Project Khulo will analyse how a person with for example Computer Science or Electrical Engineering have the potential of  becoming a Data Scientist while phase 2 will focus on estimating the probabilities of other careers as well. This project will further help a user find the quickest routes to becoming a data scientist on the other hand will help institutions fund those sub careers with the potential of becoming data scientists.

### Analysis
​
#### The job market
​
Project Khulo's observations, on the data they retrieved from Careers24, is that ICT jobs are more in Johannesburg and Cape Town compared to Finance jobs that are widely available all over the country. They found that the job market for ICT jobs prefer people who are familiar with programming language Java, Python, C and PHP.
