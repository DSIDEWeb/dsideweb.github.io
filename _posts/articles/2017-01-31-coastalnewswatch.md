### Project Description

Project-Coastal NewsWatch is a project that is tasked to develop a Oceans and coastal information system management where researchers and managers have access to details of the events happening in certain areas of interest, the location of these events and the causes thereof.
The Project-Coastal NewsWatch team developed a dashboard visualizing geospatial events on South African coasts; visualizing topic media based data about South Africaâ€™s coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); applied exploratory Geospatial Visual Analytics to harvest information by their topic to aid in delivering rapid information.
