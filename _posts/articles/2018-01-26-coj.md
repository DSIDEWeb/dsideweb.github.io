### Project Description

The project ultimately seeks to put under the microscope City of Johannesburg’s projects and their budget allocations (from the financial year 2012/2013 to the 2018/2019). This aims to look whether budget allocations for the different regions in the City of Johannesburg are done fairly and are the projects going according to plan (with regards to the budget). 

The project has been brought about by the interest as well as need to see whether projects are executed as per the city’s business plan and implementation program. The project thus has an objective of solving issues with regards to service delivery of the city’s projects and essentially solve these arising issues by providing recommendations, in terms of the budget, of how projects can be better implemented as per the city’s plans.

The problem at hand is the need to see whether the City of Johannesburg is in line with its development plans and if money is being allocated appropriately. They also need to keep track of their progress as they move forward as well as have a system that will improve the management and storing of city data.
We have three main research questions:
* Are the budget allocations fair?
* Are the projects executed according to the city’s business and project implementation plan?
* Are the projects allocated fairly amongst the different city regions?
