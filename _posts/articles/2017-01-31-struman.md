The Project- Struman Bridge Managementâ€˜s main aim is to create a system that summarises data about various structure types and visualise it so that the road authorities to manage their respective road structures easily.

The first Struman Bridge Management System team developed a dashboard visualizing three main components where the end-user can select the required authority, structure type and all the structures belonging to the particular authority, were populated on a map with a pie chart to assist in navigating through the different index categories as well as predicted the quality of those structure for the authority selected. The Struman Bridge Management system further loaded Inventory data and inspection data with automatic submission for editing and updating information for specific structures. Below is the diagram showing the design structure of the Struman Bridge Management:
