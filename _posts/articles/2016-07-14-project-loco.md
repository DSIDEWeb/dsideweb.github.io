### Project Description

​Project Loco is a project tackling the problem of resource allocation for law enforcement. The project is tracking how crime activity is happening in South Africa. Loco uses data collected from Twitter, where people posted information about crime or public safety incidents as they happen. The overall objective of Loco was understand the temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal behaviour of these incidents. Further, the project aims to predict the future of incidents so that law enforcement can best allocate resources where necessary. Phase one mainly focused on data related to hijacking incidents, phase two will focus on all the types of incidents as well as predictive models. This project builds on a project in the 2015/2016 season, Project Siphon.​
