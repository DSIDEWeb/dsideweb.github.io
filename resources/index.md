<!-- ![DSIDE Workshop](/images/dside3wide.jpg) -->

## Introduction

We primarily use Python as the language of choice for Data Science within the programme. As such, we would suggest you first take a look through a resource such as [Journey from a Python noob to a Kaggler on Python](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-data-science-python/).

The page below gives various resources recommended by our Staff, Mentors and Students.

## Online Courses

### Programming

#### Python
* Programming foundations with Python [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036) **#Beginner**
* Introduction to Algorithms [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs215) **#Intermediate**
* Full stack Foundations [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088 ) **#Intermediate**

This should be a good base for you to start our programme. If your programming is shaky or you donâ€™t have experience in Python, it would be best that you start with these classes.

#### Web  

* Introduction to JavaScript [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804/) **#Beginner**
* The Django Book (Updated for Django 1.8) [DjangoBook](http://masteringdjango.com/django-book/) (not a class but, great to learn Django) **#Intermediate**

### Data Science

* Intro to Data Analysis [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) **#Beginner**

The courses below are primarily aimed at Phase 2 of the programme (December/January). It depends mainly on what project a student is working on.

* Practical Machine Learning (from Johns Hopkins University) **#Intermediate**
* Cluster Analysis in Data Mining (from Jiawei Han) **#Intermediate**
* Text mining and Analytics (University of Illinois at UC) **#Intermediate**
* Text Retrieval and Search Engines **#Intermediate**
* Data mining (University of Illinois at UC) **#Intermediate**
* Data Visualization (University of Illinois at UC) **#Intermediate**
