## Introduction

We primarily use Python as the language of choice for Data Science within the program. As such we would first suggest a look through a resource such as [Journey from a Python noob to a Kaggler on Python](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/learning-path-data-science-python/). There is a lot of material out there to learn. This page just presents a couple of the resources recommended by our Staff, Mentors and Students.
